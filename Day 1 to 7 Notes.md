# Ethernet Configuration
There are many types of configurations available with different MCUs. Some MCUs let you configure the memory in the CubeMX, while others donâ€™t. Some of the Boards have the MII Hardware, while other have RMII.

### Before proceeding further Things to learn
1- QSPI  
2- MPU Configuration  
3- Special memory configuration  
4- Flash script

## QSPI  
## MPU (Memory Protection Unit)  
-Memory Protection Unit is a piece of hardware in modern MCUs  
-Prevents a process from accessing an unallocated region  
-Allows privileged access to defined regions  
-Can be controlled with attributes  
-Monitors every transaction (including instruction fetch)  
-Violation triggers fault exception  

# Uses of MPU
 Speculative Access
 DMA Issues
 Task Management
